New in release 1.9 (XXXX-XX-XX)

New in release 1.8 (2008-11-20)

  IcedTea is based on the hard work of a lot of people that contributed to
  IcedTea6 and OpenJDK. The following noteworthy changes were added in
  this release:

- Updated to b39 build.
- Support for external projects (closures, caciocavallo, cvmi, bsd, nio2).
  Note that these are based on Mercurial repositories so may require local

  NIO2 was buildable out of the box.

  supported now without any (regional) restrictions. No more need for
  separate crypto policy jars.

  (See http://icedtea.classpath.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=179 when
   you want to enable non-system-installed versions of Rhino).

New in release 1.7 (2008-06-02)

  IcedTea is based on the hard work of a lot of people that contributed to
  IcedTea6 and OpenJDK. The following noteworthy changes were added in
  this release:

  - Paul Hohensee published a GNU/Linux hotspot Sparc port and Matthias
   Klose integrated it into IcedTea.
  - Keith Seiths and Andrew Haley made fixes to the awt color package so
   that it now provides the lcms library with PYCC and LINEAR_RGB ICC
   profiles, fixing several applications that did complex color
   transformations.
  - Karl Helgason wrote a midi software synthesizer called Gervill that
   is now integrated in IcedTea so that javax.sound.midi support works
   now. Mark Wielaard integrated it and made some fixes so that it works
   better with javax.sound.sampled.
  - Jonathan Gibbons released a free version of jtreg, which was imported
   into IcedTea by Mark Wielaard so that a make check now runs all the
   functional unit tests integrated into OpenJDK.
  - Joshua Sumali made lots of fixes to the javaws/netx support. Including
   improved security, namely catching Socket permissions during runtime,
   implementing the remaining JNLP services api (PrintService and
   JNLPRandomAccessFile), and applet focusing bug fixes, so now netx
   plays nice with gcjwebplugin.
  - Kelly O'Hair resolved the license issues with the (j)hat tool which is
   now integrated.
  - Lillian Angel and Tom Fitzsimmons added several .desktop files for
   the various tools included for better GNU/Linux desktop integration.
  - Thomas Fitzsimmons rewrote the cacert support to resolve issues with
   applications like Glashfish and Eclipse which access the keystore
   directly.
  - Lillian Angel made lots of bug fixes to the packaging and integration
   support, include improving the font support.
  - IcedTea6 1.2 and IcedTea[7] 1.7 are completely synced up again thanks
   to Andrew John Hughes.
  - Andrew also did all the work to make sure IcedTea[7] is now based on
   OpenJDK7 b26 as released by Xiomara Jayasena.
  - Thomas Fitzsimmons rewrote the certificate keystore support.
  - Christian Thalinger made various cacao integration fixes.
