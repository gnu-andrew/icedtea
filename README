IcedTea
=======

The IcedTea project provides a harness to build the source code from
openjdk.java.net using Free Software tools and dependencies.

IcedTea addresses two problems: it eliminates the build requirement on
proprietary build tools and it provides replacements for the
"encumbered binary plugs".

These plugs are described at http://openjdk.java.net: "Not all of the
source code that makes up the JDK is available under an open-source
license. In order to build an OpenJDK binary from source code, you
must first download and install one or more of the following files
from which the build process will copy over 'binary plugs' for these
encumbered components."

This project uses code from GNU Classpath, code generated during a
build of the openjdk.java.net source code, and stub code written by
Red Hat, to provide Free Software replacements for these encumbered
binary plugs.

IcedTea also provides build scripts and patches that allow the source
code from openjdk.java.net to be built with IcedTea itself.

See INSTALL for build instructions.

Java compatibility
------------------

IcedTea is derived from OpenJDK, Sun's open-source implementation of
the Java SE platform.  At this time the build from which IcedTea was
constructed corresponds to an early build of JDK 7.  When JDK 7
is complete it will implement the Java SE 7 Platform Specification.
Work on that specification is underway, but far from final.  Any APIs
in the JDK 7 implementation, whether new or old, are therefore subject
to minor adjustments, major revisions, or even outright removal
between now and the time that the Java SE 7 Platform Specification is
finalized.  Please take these facts into account before depending upon
IcedTea.

Recently, OpenJDK6 was released. This build is now based on that release.

How the Stub Replacements were Produced
---------------------------------------

To produce the plug replacements, we began by satisfying as many
undefined references as possible using code from a completed build of
the source code from openjdk.java.net.  Then we supplemented the
resultant tree with more replacement code from GNU Classpath.
Following that, we fixed each remaining build error by creating the
simplest possible stub code.

A Note About License Headers
----------------------------

Some sources downloaded from openjdk.java.net do not display the GPL
license header.  Instances are:

 - The files in openjdk/jdk/src/share/classes/javax/xml/stream/ seem to 
   comprise the BEA-StAX source code

   http://ftpna2.bea.com/pub/downloads/jsr173.jar

   with some Sun-specific modifications.  We're assuming that Sun is
   bundling BEA-StAX under the terms of the Apache License 2.0 and
   that the modifications are owned by Sun.

 - We are assuming that these files are owned by Sun:
   openjdk/jdk/src/share/classes/**/resources/*.properties


gcjwebplugin
============

gcjwebplugin provides basic support for running applets in
Mozilla-based web browsers.  It does not support applet/Javascript
communication (LiveConnect) and support for signed applets needs
further testing.  The current applet security manager may be too
strict and may require tuning to allow otherwise-legitimate calls by
untrusted applets.

gcjwebplugin itself is a shared object, gcjwebplugin.so, built from a
single source file, gcjwebplugin.cc.  The IcedTea adaptation of
gcjwebplugin communicates through named pipes with a modified version
of IcedTea's appletviewer.  Two source files,
openjdk/jdk/src/share/classes/sun/applet/PluginAppletViewer.java,
openjdk/jdk/src/share/classes/sun/applet/PluginMain.java are added to
rt.jar and tools.jar to provide gcjwebplugin with an interface into
the appletviewer code.  This support code is provided in
patches/icedtea-plugin.patch.

If the option --enable-netx-plugin is passed to configure, this will
make all applets run through NetX security instead of the default
security manager. This feature is experimental, and is not enabled by
default. Note that if --disable-gcjwebplugin is used, --enable-netx-plugin
will not work.

NetX
====

NetX provides a drop-in replacement for javaws (Java Web Start). Since
upstream NetX is dormant, we will be hosting and modifying the sources
in the IcedTea repository, particularly in the rt/net/sourceforge/jnlp
directory.

The NetX sources are built into rt.jar

IcedTea's NetX currently supports verification of signed jars, trusted
certificate storing, system certificate store checking, and provides
some services specified by the jnlp API.

CACAO as VM
===========

The --with-cacao configure option replaces the libjvm.so from Sun's
HotSpot with the one from the CACAO VM.  This enables the usage of
IcedTea on architectures which are not supported by the HotSpot VM,
besides the HotSpot zero port.  In contrast to the HotSpot zero port,
CACAO provides a Just-In-Time compiler for various architectures.
