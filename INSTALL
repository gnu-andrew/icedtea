Building IcedTea
================

For convenience we've provided make targets that automatically
download, extract and patch the source code from openjdk.java.net, in
a default location.

To build IcedTea, do:

./configure [OPTION]... [VAR=VALUE]...
make

There is currently no install target.

The build requirements are as follows:

GNU libgcj 4.1.2
Eclipse Java Compiler 3.2.1
CUPS
libX11 (libXp, libXtst, libXi, libXt)
lesstif
Freetype2
patch
sed
unzip
md5sum
wget
alsa
xalan
xerces
firefox-devel
glib2-devel 
gtk2-devel

See ./configure --help if you need to override defaults.

IcedTea ends up in openjdk/control/build/linux-i586 or
openjdk/control/build/linux-amd64 when the build completes.

Building IcedTea with IcedTea
-----------------------------

To perform a full bootstrap, do:

./configure
make

This builds IcedTea against ecj running on libgcj first then uses the
result of that build to build IcedTea again.

Rebuilding The IcedTea Plugs
----------------------------

When IcedTea is initially built, it creates stamp files to determine what
and when dependencies were compiled. For example, to rebuild the rt/jce plugs
certain files need to be deleted before restarting the build.

 - If the jce plugs have been modified, delete jce-class-files.stamp.
 - If a new class has been added to the jce plugs, delete 
 jce-source-files.txt so it can be recreated with the new class list.
 - If the rt plugs have been modified, delete rt-class-files.stamp.
 - If a new class has been added to the rt plugs, delete
 rt-source-files.txt  so it can be recreated with the new class list.
