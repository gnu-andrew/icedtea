Building IcedTea
================

For convenience we've provided make targets that automatically
download, extract and patch the source code from openjdk.java.net, in
a default location.

The build requirements are as follows:

GNU libgcj 4.1.2
Eclipse Java Compiler 3.2.1
CUPS
libX11 (libXp, libXtst, libXi, libXt)
lesstif
Freetype2
patch
sed
unzip
md5sum
wget
alsa
xalan
xerces
firefox-devel
glib2-devel 
gtk2-devel
ant >= 1.6.5
libXinerama-devel
giflib-devel
libpng-devel
libjpeg-devel
zlib-devel
mercurial 0.9.5 + forest extension

See ./configure --help if you need to override defaults.

To bootstrap IcedTea with ecj:
./configure 
make

To build IcedTea with an older version of IcedTea, use:
./configure --with-icedtea 
	[default location: /usr/lib/jvm/java-icedtea, 
		to specifiy location use --with-icedtea-home=/path/to/icedtea]
make


There is currently no install target.

IcedTea ends up in openjdk/control/build/linux-i586 or
openjdk/control/build/linux-amd64 when the build completes.


Rebuilding The IcedTea Plugs
----------------------------

When IcedTea is initially built, it creates stamp files in the stamps directory
to determine what and when dependencies were compiled. For example, to rebuild 
the rt plugs certain files need to be deleted before restarting the build.

 - If the rt plugs have been modified, delete stamps/rt-class-files.stamp.
 - If a new class has been added to the rt plugs, delete
 rt-source-files.txt  so it can be recreated with the new class list.

To view all targets that create stamp files, see 
Makefile.am (section 'All Stamped Targets').


Important Targets
-----------------

- 'make dist-openjdk' creates a zip of the openjdk sources for the current release.
